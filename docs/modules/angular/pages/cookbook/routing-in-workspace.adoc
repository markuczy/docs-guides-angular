== Overview
In OneCX, routing to application-specific or endpoint-specific URLs should be handled through the centralized workspace context. This ensures that all navigation is consistent with the current workspace configuration and dynamically adapts to the environment.

OneCX compatible application:

* should use the {workspace_service}[WorkspaceService] to construct URLs for navigation.
* should not hardcode URLs or rely on static routing logic.
* should validate the existence of routes and endpoints before attempting navigation.

== Routing Using WorkspaceService
The {workspace_service}[WorkspaceService] provides methods to:

- Dynamically construct URLs for applications and endpoints based on the current workspace.
- Validate whether a route or endpoint exists before navigating.
- Resolve endpoint aliases and inject parameters into endpoint paths.

This approach ensures that applications remain decoupled from static configurations and are fully integrated into the OneCX workspace model.
