A Topic is a similar concept to an Observable. They operate on messages passed between UI Apps using browser memory. Each topic:

* has unique name
* has version
* can publish new message
* can be subscribed to and piped for handling new messages
* can be destroyed to prevent listening to new messages
With multiple UI Apps having the same Topic instantiated (with the same name), they can communicate with each other based on the publisher-subscriber model. Whenever any Topic instance publishes new message, subscribers for all instances will read the message eventually allowing them to react on new information.
