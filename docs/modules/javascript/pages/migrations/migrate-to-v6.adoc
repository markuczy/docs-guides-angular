[#general-changes]
== General changes

[#removed-packages]
=== Removed packages
In the version 6 of OneCX the following packages are not longer available:

* *@onecx/keycloak-auth*
* *@onecx/portal-layout-styles*
* *@onecx/portal-integration-interface*

[#styles-update]
=== Update application styles
Please, make sure to *remove @onecx/portal-layout-styles and @onecx/portal-integration-interface references from application styles*.

Since version 6 styles from @onecx/portal-layout-styles will no longer be available globally on a page. *Please, make sure that your application does not use any styles (css classes, animations, etc.) defined by portal-layout-styles*. In case it does, you will need to implement those in your application.

The only css styles available for each application since version 6:

- styles exposed via app_url/styles.css file (where app_url is a url to the deployed application)
- component styles defined in the application (styles defined for each component inside the application)
- PrimeNG component styles (only if the application uses primeNG)

==== Expose styles.css on top level
In case if  your application needs to share styles between components you should make sure to *expose styles.css file. Shell will assume that this file is called styles.css and is exposed on the top level of your deployed application*. In order to make sure this is done properly, we are recommending to update the project configuration with the following config:

.project.json or angular.json
```
...
"styles": [
  {
    "input": "./src/styles.scss",
    "bundleName": "styles",
    "inject": true
  }
]
...
```

The above snippet assumes that the exposed style sheet is in *src/styles.scss*.

[#deleted-components]
=== Check deleted components
Some components will be removed. Please check if you are using following components:


[#removed-from-integration-angular]
==== Removed from @onecx/portal-integration-angular

* portal-footer 
* portal-header
* portal-viewport + 
=> *These components are now in @onecx/shell-core* 

* portal-menu
* portal-menu-horizontal 
* inline-profile +
=> *They are now remote components in onecx-workspace-ui*

* core/initializer/standalone.initializer.ts + 
=>  *Please use standalone mode instead xref:angular:pages:migrations:enable-standalone/index.adoc[Documentation]*

* services/app.menu.service.ts +
=> *If someone wants to load menu item they should create an endpoint in the BFF of the own app and create their own function.*

[#filter-type]
=== FilterType values changes
Please, make sure to update `FilterType` usage:

* `FilterType.EQUAL` &#8594; `FilterType.EQUALS`
* `FilterType.TRUTHY` &#8594; `FilterType.IS_NOT_EMPTY`

[#configuration-service]
=== Check usage of ConfigurationService 
ConfigurationService (@onecx/angular-integration-interface) is now asynchronous. Please check if usage needs to be adapted.

[#theme-service]
=== ThemeService removed functionality
ThemeService in version 6 should *only be used to access the currentTheme* via `currentTheme$` property. The following have been removed:

* `baseUrlV1` property
* `getThemeRef` function
* `loadAndApplyTheme` function 
* `apply` function 

Please, make sure that those methods are no longer used.

[#base-url]
=== BASE_URL injection token
`BASE_URL` injection token should no longer be used, instead please use `REMOTE_COMPONENT_CONFIG`

[#angular-in-webpack]
=== Adjust angular packages in webpack
Make sure that all angular packages *do not have `singleton: true` set in webpack.config.js*. 

[#translation-bootstrap]
=== Move translation providers to bootstrap.ts for Remote Components
For each Remote Component translation related providers are required to be defined in the bootstrap.ts instead of the component.ts file.

.remote-component.bootstrap.ts
```
import { bootstrapRemoteComponent } from '@onecx/angular-webcomponents'
import {
  REMOTE_COMPONENT_CONFIG,
  RemoteComponentConfig,
  provideTranslateServiceForRoot
} from '@onecx/angular-remote-components'
import { TranslateLoader } from '@ngx-translate/core'
import { ReplaySubject } from 'rxjs'
import { TRANSLATION_PATH, createTranslateLoader, remoteComponentTranslationPathFactory } from '@onecx/angular-utils'

bootstrapRemoteComponent(RemoteComponent, 'ocx-my-remote-component', environment.production, [
  ...
  { provide: REMOTE_COMPONENT_CONFIG, useValue: new ReplaySubject<RemoteComponentConfig>(1) },
  provideTranslateServiceForRoot({
    isolate: true,
    loader: {
      provide: TranslateLoader,
      useFactory: createTranslateLoader,
      deps: [HttpClient]
    }
  }),
  {
    provide: TRANSLATION_PATH,
    useFactory: (remoteComponentConfig: ReplaySubject<RemoteComponentConfig>) =>
      remoteComponentTranslationPathFactory('assets/i18n/')(remoteComponentConfig),
    multi: true,
    deps: [REMOTE_COMPONENT_CONFIG]
  }
])
```

[#primeng-related-changes]
== PrimeNG related changes

[#new-plugin]
=== Add required plugin to webpack config (will be changed to OneCX plugin)
Since version 6 it's required to add the following plugin to the webpack configuration of the application.

.Webpack plugin snippet
```
const { ModifySourcePlugin, ReplaceOperation } = require('modify-source-webpack-plugin')
...
const modifyPrimeNgPlugin = new ModifySourcePlugin({
  rules: [
    {
      test: (module) => {
        return module.resource && module.resource.includes('primeng')
      },
      operations: [
        new ReplaceOperation(
          'all',
          'document\\.createElement\\(([^)]+)\\)',
          'document.createElementFromPrimeNg({"this": this, "arguments": Array.from(arguments), element: $1})'
        ),
        new ReplaceOperation('all', 'Theme.setLoadedStyleName', '(function(_){})')
      ]
    }
  ]
})
module.exports = {
  ...webpackConfig,
  plugins: [...plugins, modifyPrimeNgPlugin]
}
```

[#theme-config]
=== Provide ThemeConfig
Since version 6 of OneCX it is required to add an additional provider to the Microfrontends and Remote Components.

.mfe.remote.module.ts
```
import { provideThemeConfig } from '@onecx/angular-utils'
...
@NgModule({
    providers: [
        provideThemeConfig()
    ]
}) export class MyMfe {}
```

.remote-component.bootstrap.ts
```
import { provideThemeConfig } from '@onecx/angular-utils'

bootstrapRemoteComponent(RemoteComponent, 'my-remote-component', environment.production, [
  provideThemeConfig()
])
```

[#theme-overrides]
==== Provide theme overrides
The new theming system introduced in version 6 of OneCX is based on PrimeNG's theming mechanism. However, in OneCX it is possible to style the content differently per Application. The mechanism that allows that is called theme overrides.

Each Mfe or Remote Component can specify their overrides that will guarantee that certain styles are applied differently than in other applications on the page. Here is an example of how to provide overrides.

```
provideThemeConfig({
  overrides: {
    semantic: {
      extend: {
        onecx: {
          secondaryColor: 'red'
        },
      },
      focusRing: {
        width: '2px',
        style: 'solid',
        color: '{primary.color}',
        offset: '0px',
        shadow: 'none',
      },
    }
  }
})
```

In this example:

* the *secondary color* theme variable is changed
* the *default focus highlight* is changed

More about what and how to override can be found in {theming_url}[theming documentation].

[#further-considerations]
== Further considerations
[#angular-19-further-changes]
=== Angular 19 changes
Make sure to adjust the Application to the Angular 19 requirements. Based on the implementation there could be changes required to be made to ensure compatibility.

[#primeng-19-further-changes]
=== PrimeNG 19 changes
If the migrated Application uses PrimeNG components, please make sure to adjust the implementation according to the PrimeNG 19 requirements and API changes.
